# Recommendations

> Some folks call this a "Tech Radar"; but I prefer *lidar* because lasers are cooler.

## Overview

There are three categories to our recommendations and they are defined as follows:

- **Adopt** – You should definitely be using this if you have a good reason to use it.
- **Trial** – This is worth looking into or trying in a proof of concept.
- **Assess** – This may or may not be the future, but it's totally up in the air at this point.

## Current Recommendations

- React

### Trial
